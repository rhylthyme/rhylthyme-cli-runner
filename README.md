# Run examples directly
rhylthyme run examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json
```

### Option 3: Download Individual Examples

```bash
# Download a specific example file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhylthyme/rhylthyme-examples/main/programs/breakfast_schedule.json

# Run the downloaded file
rhylthyme run breakfast_schedule.json
```

## Quick Start

The Rhylthyme CLI provides commands for working with real-time program schedules defined using the Rhylthyme JSON or YAML schema.

### Generate a Program from Plain Language

`generate` sends your request to the hosted MCP server at
`mcp.rhylthyme.com`, which builds a validated multi-track program and
publishes it as a live timeline. Sign in once first; the session is kept
in `~/.config/rhylthyme/credentials.json` and renews itself.

```bash
rhylthyme login     # opens rhylthyme.com in your browser

# Prints the Gantt chart, the itinerary and the live-timeline URL
rhylthyme generate "roast chicken, potatoes and green beans for 6" \
    -e kitchen --by 19:00 --with "one oven, four burners, one cook"

# From a file, save the program, then run it here in the terminal
rhylthyme generate -e lab -f western_blot.txt -o blot.json --run

# From stdin, print only the URL
pbpaste | rhylthyme generate -e events --by "doors at 18:30" -q
```

The server runs several model turns per request (20–60 s, capped per day).
Headless machines can set `RHYLTHYME_TOKEN` to an access token from
<https://www.rhylthyme.com/mcp/auth> instead of running `login`.

### Validate a Program

Validate a program file against the schema to ensure it's properly formatted:

```bash
# Validate a JSON or YAML program file
rhylthyme validate my_program.json

# Validate with verbose output
rhylthyme validate my_program.json --verbose

# Validate with JSON output for CI/scripting
rhylthyme validate my_program.json --json

# Validate in strict mode (requires all tasks in resourceConstraints)
rhylthyme validate my_program.json --strict
```

### Run a Program

Run a program with an interactive terminal UI for monitoring and controlling execution:

```bash
# Run a program file
rhylthyme run examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json

# Run with automatic start (no manual trigger needed)
rhylthyme run examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json --auto-start

# Run with a different time scale (2x faster)
rhylthyme run examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json --time-scale 2.0

# Run with a specific environment
rhylthyme run examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json --environment kitchen

# Run without validation (if you're sure the file is valid)
rhylthyme run examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json --no-validate
```

### Analyze and Publish a Program

Neither needs an account; both are computed by the hosted MCP server.

```bash
# Total length, critical path, resource conflicts
rhylthyme analyze examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json

# When does each step start if breakfast is at 8:30?
rhylthyme analyze examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json --finish-at 8:30am

# A live, shareable timeline with timers; prints the URL
rhylthyme publish examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json
```

`validate` checks structure only. Two steps that want the only oven at the
same time pass validation; `analyze` reports them, and `--strict` makes that
a non-zero exit.

### Optimize a Program

`plan` is an older stagger heuristic that reads the pre-0.2 program format; on
programs written with `stepId` and `task` (all current examples) it writes the
program back unchanged. Use `analyze` to find contention.

```bash
# Optimize a program and save to new file
rhylthyme plan examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json optimized_breakfast.json

# Optimize with verbose output
rhylthyme plan examples/programs/breakfast_schedule.json optimized_breakfast.json --verbose
```

### Work with Environments

List and validate environment catalogs:

```bash
# List all available environments
rhylthyme environments

# List environments in JSON format
rhylthyme environments --format json

# Validate all environment files
rhylthyme validate-environments

# Show information about a specific environment type
rhylthyme environment-info kitchen
```

## Claude Skill

[`skills/rhylthyme`](skills/rhylthyme) is an [Agent Skill](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)
that teaches Claude (Claude Code, the Claude apps, the Agent SDK) to turn a
protocol, recipe or run sheet into a validated program with this CLI, check
it for conflicts, and hand back a live timeline. It follows the layout of
[K-Dense scientific skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills):
a `SKILL.md` plus `references/`.

```bash
# Claude Code, for one user
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/rhylthyme ~/.claude/skills/

# or for one project
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -r skills/rhylthyme .claude/skills/
```

Then ask, for example, "time a Western blot so imaging is at 4 pm" or "two PCR
protocols, one thermocycler: when do I start each?". `tests/test_skill.py`
validates every program in the skill and checks that every command it names
exists.

## Program File Examples

### Simple Breakfast Schedule

```json
{
  "programId": "breakfast-schedule",
  "name": "Breakfast Schedule",
  "description": "Coordinated breakfast preparation",
  "environmentType": "kitchen",
  "startTrigger": {
    "type": "manual"
  },

}
```

## Interactive UI Controls

When running a program, the interactive UI provides these controls:

- **Space**: Start/stop the program
- **Enter**: Trigger manual steps
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between steps
- **q**: Quit the program
- **r**: Refresh the display
- **s**: Sort by different criteria

## Command Reference

### `rhylthyme generate [REQUEST...]`

Turns a natural-language request into a program and a live timeline using
the hosted MCP server's `import_text` and `visualize_schedule` tools.
Requires `rhylthyme login` (or `RHYLTHYME_TOKEN`).

**Options:**
- `-e, --env`: `generic` (default), `kitchen`, `lab`, `events` or `gym`
- `--by TEXT`: when everything must be finished, e.g. `19:00`
- `--with TEXT`: equipment and people limits, e.g. `one oven, two cooks`
- `-f, --file PATH`: read the request or source text from a file (`-` for stdin)
- `-o, --output PATH`: save the program JSON
- `--run`: run the program in the terminal UI afterwards
- `--open`: open the live timeline in a browser
- `--no-publish`: build the program only
- `--json`: print `{url, program, ...}` as JSON
- `-q, --quiet`: print only the URL

Environment: `RHYLTHYME_TOKEN` (access token, overrides the stored session),
`RHYLTHYME_MCP_URL` (default `https://mcp.rhylthyme.com/mcp`),
`RHYLTHYME_SITE_URL` (default `https://www.rhylthyme.com`).

### `rhylthyme mcp-test`

Smoke-tests a Rhylthyme MCP server and exits 1 if any check fails. By
default it runs the read-only checks against all five hosted endpoints
(`/mcp`, `/kitchen/mcp`, `/lab/mcp`, `/events/mcp`, `/gym/mcp`):

| Check | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `initialize` | server name, protocol version, tools/resources/prompts capabilities, instructions |
| `tools` | core tools and the endpoint's one-shot tools are listed, each with a description and schema |
| `validate-good` / `validate-bad` | a valid program passes (including a `type: "compound"` trigger); a dangling step reference is rejected with a fix hint |
| `analyze` | makespan, critical path and wall-clock itinerary for a known program |
| `resources` / `prompts` | schema and guides are readable, a bundled example validates, `plan_schedule` substitutes its arguments |
| `json-accept` | clients that do not accept SSE (`*/*`, `application/json`) get JSON, not 406 |
| `bad-requests` | unknown method gives -32601, unknown tool gives an error, never a 5xx |
| `login-gate` | account tools refuse without a token and point at `login` |
| `catalog` | public search returns entries that load with a URL (empty catalog = warning) |
| `publish` (`--publish`) | `visualize_schedule` returns a URL on the right site; the page and PNG load |
| `generate` (`--generate`) | the model-backed `import_text` returns a program that validates (needs `login`) |

```bash
rhylthyme mcp-test                         # everything read-only
rhylthyme mcp-test -e lab --publish        # one endpoint, plus a real share
rhylthyme mcp-test -k catalog -k tools     # only some checks
rhylthyme mcp-test --url http://localhost:3000/mcp -e generic
rhylthyme mcp-test --json --strict         # cron / CI: warnings fail too
```

Requests carry `mcp-test` in the User-Agent so the hosted server logs the
errors these checks provoke without alerting anyone. The same suite is
importable (`rhylthyme_cli_runner.remote.checks.run_suite`), and
`RHYLTHYME_MCP_LIVE=1 pytest tests/test_mcp_checks.py` runs it live.

### `rhylthyme login` / `logout` / `whoami`

`login` opens the rhylthyme.com sign-in page and receives the session on a
one-shot listener bound to `127.0.0.1`; `--token TOKEN` stores a pasted
access token instead and `--no-browser` only prints the URL. `whoami`
shows the stored account and expiry; `logout` deletes the stored session.

### `rhylthyme validate`

Validates program files against the schema.

**Options:**
- `--schema PATH`: Path to schema file (default: built-in schema)
- `--verbose, -v`: Show detailed validation information

### `rhylthyme run`

Runs programs with interactive terminal UI.

**Options:**
- `--schema PATH`: Path to schema file (default: built-in schema)
- `-e, --environment TEXT`: Environment ID to use
- `--time-scale FLOAT`: Time scale factor (default: 1.0)
- `--validate / --no-validate`: Validate before running (default: True)
- `--auto-start`: Automatically start without manual trigger

### `rhylthyme analyze`

Total length, critical path, what gates each link of it, resource conflicts
and tracks that finish early. No sign-in; nothing is published.

**Options:**
- `--finish-at TEXT`: when everything must be finished (`19:00`, `7:30pm` or ISO 8601); prints local clock times per step
- `--start-at TEXT`: when the program starts; ignored with `--finish-at`
- `--strict`: exit non-zero when there are resource conflicts
- `--json`: the full analysis

### `rhylthyme publish`

Publishes a program file as a live timeline and prints its URL. No sign-in.
A published timeline is reachable by anyone who has the link.

**Options:**
- `-e, --env`: `generic`, `kitchen`, `lab`, `events`, `gym` (default: from `environmentType`)
- `-q, --quiet`: print only the URL
- `--json`: `url`, `shareId`, `imageUrl`, `makespanSeconds`, `warnings`
- `--open`: open it in a browser

### `rhylthyme plan`

An older stagger heuristic. It reads the pre-0.2 program format and leaves
programs written with `stepId` and `task` unchanged; use `analyze` to find
contention and edit the triggers.

**Options:**
- `--verbose, -v`: Show detailed planning information

### `rhylthyme environments`

Lists available environment catalogs.

**Options:**
- `--format, -f`: Output format (table, json, yaml)

### `rhylthyme validate-environments`

Validates environment catalog files.

**Options:**
- `--environments-dir PATH`: Directory containing environment files
- `--verbose, -v`: Show detailed validation information

### `rhylthyme environment-info`

Shows information about a specific environment type.

### `rhylthyme eval-prompts`

Scores agent-authored programs against the expert gold set. See
"Evaluating prompts" below for the full flag list.

## Evaluating prompts

`eval-prompts` measures how well a prompt gets a model to author a
Rhylthyme program. It compares a predicted program with the expert gold
program of the same slug in `rhylthyme-examples/gold/` and reports
per-component precision/recall: steps, durations, resources, actors,
relationships (triggers), track Rand index, an end-to-end pass and the
unsupported-step rate.

Two modes:

```bash
# Offline: score programs already on disk (no model calls, no cost).
rhylthyme eval-prompts --score-only \
  --gold ../rhylthyme-examples/gold --predicted /tmp/predicted

# Live: render a prompt pattern per gold source, call a model, extract
# the program JSON, validate it, score it.
rhylthyme eval-prompts \
  --gold ../rhylthyme-examples/gold \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --patterns baseline,four-turn
```

**Patterns** (`--list-patterns`):

| pattern | what it sends |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | The single `plan_schedule` message the MCP server sent before Phase 3, frozen in `eval/patterns/baseline.py` so the committed numbers stay reproducible. |
| `four-turn` | The four messages `plan_schedule` sends today, byte-copied from `rhylthyme-server/mcp-api/prompts.js`: T1 read-back → T2 model check → T3 extraction (steps + source spans, no relationships) → T4 relationships (tracks, triggers, the refined dependency question, then the program). |

Both patterns end in the same validate-and-repair loop and get the same
system prompt, so the only variable between them is the shape of the user
turns. `four-turn` also records the paper's 2/1/0 score for T1 and T2 in
`results.json` under `extras` (`t1_score`, `t2_score`): 2 when the reply
carries the expected JSON shape first time, 1 when a single retry turn
recovers it, 0 when it never does — plus `unsupported_step_ids`, the
steps the model itself marked `inferred` in T3.

**Flags**

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--gold PATH` | Gold set directory (required). |
| `--score-only` | Offline mode; needs `--predicted`. |
| `--predicted PATH` | Directory of predicted programs (`<slug>.json` or `<slug>/program.json`). |
| `--model ID` | Model id for a live run (required unless `--score-only`). Pin it; do not let it drift. |
| `--patterns NAMES` | Comma-separated prompt patterns (default `baseline`). `--list-patterns` prints the registry. |
| `--only SLUGS` | Comma-separated gold slugs to run; applied before `--limit`. |
| `--limit N` | Run only the first N gold programs (slug order). |
| `--concurrency N` | Programs run in parallel (default 1). |
| `--from-cache` | Never call the model: replay cached responses, and fail loudly on a missing key. |
| `--cache-dir PATH` | Where raw responses are cached (default `<out>/cache`). |
| `--max-fix-iterations N` | How many times Python-validator findings are sent back as the next user turn (default 2; 0 disables the fix loop). |
| `--max-tokens N` | `max_tokens` per model call (default 16000). |
| `--write-baseline PATH` | Also write `{model, pattern, date, git_note, results}` there. |
| `--out PATH` | Where `results.json`, `results.md`, `responses/` and `predicted/` are written (default `./eval-results`). |
| `--format table\|json` | What to print to stdout. |
| `--skip-js` | Skip the JavaScript validator even when `node` is available. |
| `--threshold FLOAT` | Minimum source-span overlap for two steps to match (default 0.5). |
| `--verbose, -v` | Per-program breakdown under the table. |

**Sub-command** `eval-prompts compare` gates a run against the committed
numbers instead of printing them:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--baseline FILE` | The stored reference. Use `eval/four-turn.json` — that is what ships. |
| `--results FILE` | `results.json` from the run under test. |
| `--rel-f1-drop N` | Largest tolerated fall in relationships F1, in points (default 5). |
| `--e2e-drop N` | Largest tolerated fall in the end-to-end pass rate, in points (default 0: any drop fails). |
| `--allow-missing` | Do not fail when the results file is missing a program the reference has. |
| `--format table\|json` | Diff table, or the same comparison as JSON. |

**Cost.** A live run spends real money: one call per turn per gold
program, plus one per retry and one per fix iteration. The published
baseline run cost **$1.10** for 24 programs and 49 calls on
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (358k input / 148k output tokens); the
four-turn run over the same 24 cost **$2.20** for 111 calls (969k / 246k)
— four turns instead of one, each carrying the whole conversation so far.
The run prints its own token totals and an estimated cost from the price
table in `src/rhylthyme_cli_runner/eval/llm.py` (prices as of
2026-06-24); an unpriced model reports `unknown` instead of a number.
`--limit`/`--only` keep a trial run cheap.

**Cache.** Every call is cached under `--cache-dir` (default
`<out>/cache`) keyed by sha256 of the model, the pattern name, the system
prompt and the full message list, so each turn of a multi-turn pattern is
cached separately and re-scoring never re-spends. `--from-cache` replays
and refuses to call the API; a missing key is an error naming the slug and
the key. The committed cache for both published runs is `eval/cache/`
(1.44 MB, 160 files). Only the completion is replayed, so the committed
files keep the completion in full and record the prompt side as digests
(`system_sha256`, `messages_sha256`) plus a role/length shape — the cache
is in the repository, so it is kept small on purpose.

**Reading the table.** One row per program, then a mean row:

```
program                               steps P/R/F1    dur acc  res P/R    actors  rel P/R/F1      tracks RI  e2e   unsupp
kitchen-weeknight-stir-fry            1.00/0.87/0.93  1.00     0.00/0.00  1.00    0.62/0.47/0.53  0.97       0.00  0.19
```

- `steps` — matched by source-span overlap ≥ `--threshold`, else by
  normalised name. Precision near 1.00 with low recall means the model
  wrote real steps but far fewer of them than the expert did (it lumps).
- `dur acc` — of matched steps, how many got the duration kind and value right.
- `res P/R` — `resourceConstraints[].task` names.
- `actors` — program `actors` count (1 or 0).
- `rel P/R/F1` — triggers: same owning step, same anchor step, same type,
  offset within 10 %. This is the number the four-turn work in Phase 3
  has to move; the paper this work follows found relationships are the
  weak component, and the baseline agrees.
- `tracks RI` — Rand index of the step-to-track partition.
- `e2e` — passes both validators, makespan within 10 % of gold, critical
  chain shares ≥ 50 % of gold's steps.
- `unsupp` — predicted steps with no gold match and no locatable span, as
  a share of predicted steps. Not counted as errors (PRD open question 4).

A program whose reply carried no parseable program, or one that still
fails the validator after the fix loop, is scored zero on every component
and listed under the table, so a failed run lowers the mean instead of
shrinking the sample.

**`eval/baseline.json`** and **`eval/four-turn.json`** are the committed
numbers, in the same shape: the model pin, the pattern, the date, a git
note for the commit they were produced from, and the full per-program
results. `eval/four-turn.json` is the one CI gates on — it is the pattern
`plan_schedule` ships; `eval/baseline.json` is kept as the historical
single-message number so this table can show what the four turns bought.

### Published numbers

All 24 gold programs, `--max-fix-iterations 2`, `--concurrency 3`, both
patterns on the same model on the same day.

**Baseline vs four-turn, means over all 24 programs:**

| metric | baseline | four-turn | change |
|---|---|---|---|
| steps precision | 0.88 | 0.91 | +0.04 |
| steps recall | 0.37 | 0.95 | +0.58 |
| steps F1 | 0.48 | 0.92 | +0.44 |
| durations accuracy | 0.85 | 0.92 | +0.06 |
| resources P/R | 0.57/0.54 | 0.56/0.56 | −0.00/+0.02 |
| actors accuracy | 0.79 | 0.83 | +0.04 |
| **relationships F1** | **0.22** | **0.63** | **+0.41** |
| tracks Rand index | 0.80 | 0.93 | +0.12 |
| **end-to-end pass** | **0.08** | **0.62** | **+0.54** |
| unsupported-step rate | 0.60 | 0.01 | −0.59 |
| calls / cost | 49 / $1.10 | 111 / $2.20 | ×2.3 / ×2.0 |

The hypothesis holds on both numbers the PRD names, and by more on 24
programs than it did on the first 6: relationship F1 nearly triples
(0.22 → 0.63) and the end-to-end pass rate goes from 2/24 to 15/24.
The mechanism is extraction, not inference. The single-message prompt
lumps a source into just over a third of the steps the expert wrote
(recall 0.37) and fills the gaps with work the text does not support
(unsupported rate 0.60), so there is little left for a trigger to point
at — and its one end-to-end failure mode, a program that never passed the
validator at all, is the run's only missing prediction
(`kitchen-two-burner-three-course-dinner`, scored zero). Asking for the
steps and their source spans *before* any relationship exists raises
recall to 0.95 and all but eliminates unsupported steps (0.01); tracks
and triggers then follow (Rand index 0.80 → 0.93). The effect is largest
where the source is longest and most repetitive: baseline recall is 0.11
on the four fitness programs (interval sets it collapses into one step)
and 0.24 in the lab, and four-turn lifts both above 0.75. Resource
constraints are the one component the four turns do not move — naming
what a step occupies is a vocabulary problem, not a structure problem —
and actors stay a coin-flip on the event and fitness sources, where the
expert counts people the text never numbers.

**Regression policy / re-baselining.** CI re-runs the `four-turn` pattern
on the pinned model and fails on a relationships-F1 drop of more than 5
points or **any** end-to-end pass-rate drop against
`eval/four-turn.json`:

```bash
rhylthyme eval-prompts compare \
  --baseline eval/four-turn.json --results eval-results/results.json \
  --rel-f1-drop 5 --e2e-drop 0
```

It prints a metric-by-metric diff, names the programs that moved, warns
(rather than fails) when the two files disagree about the model, and
exits 1 on a regression. Growing the gold set is not a regression; a
program the results file is missing is, because a program that was not
run cannot be said not to have regressed (`--allow-missing` waives it).
Never widen a threshold to land a merge. Re-baseline quarterly to rotate
the model pin, and always in a single commit that updates the pin, both
JSON files, the cache and this table — see
[`development/contributing.md`](https://rhylthyme.com/docs/development/contributing/)
for the procedure.

Reproduce both patterns, all 24 programs, without spending anything:

```bash
rhylthyme eval-prompts --gold ../rhylthyme-examples/gold \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --patterns baseline,four-turn \
  --concurrency 3 --max-fix-iterations 2 \
  --from-cache --cache-dir eval/cache --out /tmp/eval-replay
```

**Prompt under test.** `eval/patterns/four_turn.py` holds byte-identical
Python copies of the four templates in
`rhylthyme-server/mcp-api/prompts.js`, so the prompt the harness measures
is the prompt the MCP server ships. A parity test extracts the JS exports
with `node` and fails on any drift; check it by hand with

```bash
python -m rhylthyme_cli_runner.eval.patterns.four_turn
```

`eval/patterns/baseline.py` is frozen at the single-message prompt as of
Phase 2 and is deliberately *not* in step with today's `index.js`; that
is what keeps `eval/baseline.json` reproducible from the cache.
`eval/patterns/baseline.md` is its rendered copy (server `instructions` +
`rhylthyme://guide/authoring` + the `plan_schedule` message), regenerated
with `python -m rhylthyme_cli_runner.eval.patterns.baseline`; a test
fails if it goes stale.

**Tests.** The harness is unit-tested against a fake client; nothing in
`make test` calls an API. The one real-API test carries the `llm` marker
and is skipped unless `RHYLTHYME_EVAL_LIVE=1`:

```bash
make test-unit                 # excludes llm
RHYLTHYME_EVAL_LIVE=1 pytest -m llm      # one real call, opt in
```


### Other models and a spending cap

`--model` also accepts models served through an OpenAI-compatible API. The
provider is picked from the model id and the key is read from the
environment:

| Model id | Provider | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-*` | Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `deepseek-*` (e.g. `deepseek-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`) | api.deepseek.com | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| `qwen*` | Alibaba DashScope (international) | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |
| `kimi-*`, `moonshot-*` | Moonshot | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `glm-*` | Z.ai | `ZAI_API_KEY` |
| anything with a slash, e.g. `deepseek/deepseek-flash` | OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| any id, with `RHYLTHYME_EVAL_BASE_URL` set | that endpoint (vLLM, Ollama, ...) | `RHYLTHYME_EVAL_API_KEY`, optional for localhost |

Costs come from the price table in `eval/llm.py` (DeepSeek at its peak
rates, so estimates are upper bounds). For a model the table does not know,
set `RHYLTHYME_EVAL_PRICE_IN` and `RHYLTHYME_EVAL_PRICE_OUT` in USD per
million tokens.

`eval/run_model_comparison.py` runs a model under a hard budget. It runs one
gold program at a time, both prompts per program, records each program's
cost in `eval/models/spend-ledger.json`, and stops before the next program
could cross `--cap`. The ledger is cumulative across models and
invocations, and the script refuses a model with no known price (it would
be recorded as $0 and the cap would never trip).

One OpenRouter key reaches OpenAI, Qwen and Meta models (ids with a vendor
prefix). Run the cheapest first and raise the cumulative cap as you go, so
no single model can spend the whole allowance. Reasoning models need a
higher per-call output ceiling than the default 16,000 tokens:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
L=eval/models/spend-ledger-openrouter.json
python eval/run_model_comparison.py --ledger $L --model meta-llama/llama-4-maverick --cap 0.80 --first-guess 0.05
python eval/run_model_comparison.py --ledger $L --model qwen/qwen3.8-flash --cap 2.00 --first-guess 0.08 --max-tokens 64000
python eval/run_model_comparison.py --ledger $L --model openai/gpt-5.6-luna --cap 4.50 --first-guess 0.15 --max-tokens 64000
python eval/compare_models.py
```

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
python eval/run_model_comparison.py --model deepseek-flash --cap 6.70 --dry-run
python eval/run_model_comparison.py --model deepseek-flash --cap 6.70
python eval/compare_models.py        # like-for-like table across every model run so far
```
