"""``baseline`` pattern: the single-message ``plan_schedule`` prompt.

FROZEN as of Phase 2 (2026-09-14). "Baseline" means *the one-message
prompt the server sent before the four-turn rewrite*, so the numbers in
``eval/baseline.json`` stay reproducible from the committed cache: the
cache key covers the rendered prompt, and a single changed character
would miss every entry. Phase 3 replaced ``registerPrompts`` in
``index.js`` with the four turns of ``mcp-api/prompts.js`` (mirrored in
``patterns/four_turn.py``, which is parity-checked against the JS); this
module is no longer in step with ``index.js`` and is not meant to be.
Leave it alone unless you are deliberately re-baselining, which means
re-running the baseline and replacing both the cache and
``eval/baseline.json``.

The prompt text is a faithful copy of what the remote MCP server rendered
at that commit, taken from ``rhylthyme-server/mcp-api/index.js``:

* ``registerPrompts(server, vertical)`` -- the ``nouns`` map and the
  ``plan_schedule`` message lines, including the conditional
  ``Resource limits`` / ``Everything must be finished by`` lines and the
  one-shot tool name (``cook_recipe``, ``run_protocol``, ``plan_event``,
  ``start_workout``) spliced into step 1 per vertical.
* ``serverInstructions(vertical)`` -- the server-level ``instructions``
  a host receives at ``initialize``, sent here as the system prompt
  because a host sends both.
* ``AUTHORING_GUIDE`` -- the ``rhylthyme://guide/authoring`` resource that
  step 2 tells the model to read, copied verbatim into
  ``patterns/authoring_guide.md`` and appended to the system prompt
  because the harness serves no MCP resources.

``patterns/baseline.md`` is the rendered copy of all three for one worked
example; ``tests/test_eval_harness.py`` asserts it stays in step with
this module.

The harness adds two things the host would otherwise supply: a short
system preamble saying the tools are unavailable and the reply must carry
the program JSON, and the source text appended under the prompt as the
thing to schedule. Both are recorded in the transcript.
