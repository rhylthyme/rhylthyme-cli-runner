"""Prompt patterns the live harness can run.

A pattern turns one gold program's source and context into a sequence of
model turns and ends with a program JSON (or an error). Patterns are
registered by name in :data:`PATTERNS`; ``rhylthyme eval-prompts
--patterns a,b`` looks them up there. Phase 2 ships ``baseline``; Phase 3
adds ``four-turn``.

The interface is three members:

``name``
    Registry key, also written to ``results.json``.
``render(gold) -> list[Turn]``
    The turns to send, in order. A :class:`Turn` carries the user message
    for that turn (as text, or as a callable taking the list of prior
    turn replies so a later turn can quote an earlier answer) plus the
    system prompt for the request.
``parse(turn_outputs) -> program | None``
    Given every turn's reply text, in order, return the program JSON.
    The default takes the first parseable program in the last reply.

:meth:`Pattern.run` is the default driver and is what the harness calls:
it walks the turns as one growing conversation (each reply is appended as
an assistant message, so later turns see earlier ones), parses, and then
runs the shared validate-and-repair tail :func:`finish_with_fix_loop` so
fix iterations are comparable across patterns. Override ``run`` only for
control flow the turn list cannot express::

    class FourTurnPattern(Pattern):
        name = "four-turn"

        def render(self, gold):
            return [
                Turn("T1 read-back", READ_BACK.format(source=gold.source_text),
                     system=SYSTEM),
                Turn("T2 model check", MODEL_CHECK, system=SYSTEM),
                Turn("T3 extraction", scenario(gold), system=SYSTEM),
                Turn("T4 relationships",
                     lambda prior: RELATIONSHIPS.format(steps=prior[2]),
                     system=SYSTEM),
            ]

``session.complete`` is the only way a pattern talks to the model: it
routes through the response cache, records the transcript and counts
tokens.
