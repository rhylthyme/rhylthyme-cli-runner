"""``four-turn`` pattern: the four-message ``plan_schedule`` prompt.

The turn templates are a byte-identical copy of
``rhylthyme-server/mcp-api/prompts.js`` -- the same strings the remote MCP
server sends -- so the prompt under test is the prompt that ships.
``tests/test_eval_harness.py::TestJsParity`` extracts the JS exports with
``node`` and fails when the two drift; regenerate this file's copy with::

    python -m rhylthyme_cli_runner.eval.patterns.four_turn --check

The structure follows Almuntashiri, Ibanez & Chapman (ProvenanceWeek '25):

    T1 read-back      confirm the whole source was read
    T2 model check    restate the target data model, name the constraints
    T3 extraction     scenario pattern; steps + source spans, no relations
    T4 relationships  tracks, triggers, question refinement, then the program

T1 and T2 are scored 2/1/0 as the paper does: 2 when the reply carries the
expected JSON shape first time, 1 when a single retry turn recovers it, 0
when it never does. A failing run can then be attributed to reading,
modelling, extraction or relationships.

The system prompt is deliberately the *same* as the ``baseline`` pattern's
(harness preamble + the frozen Phase-2 server instructions + the authoring
guide), apart from the preamble sentence that tells the model the turns
arrive one at a time, so the only variable between the two patterns is the
shape of the user turns.

Read all of it before you answer.

Before extracting anything, restate the target data model in your own words, in five or six sentences:

- a **track** is one sequential line of work; steps in the same track never overlap, and anything that happens while something else happens belongs in a different track;
- a **step** has exactly one duration kind: `fixed` (`seconds`), `variable` (`minSeconds`, `maxSeconds`, `defaultSeconds`) or `indefinite` (runs until the person ends it);
- a **startTrigger** ties a step to the clock or to another step — `programStart`, `programStartOffset`, `afterStep`, `afterStepWithBuffer`, `manual`, `onAbort`, `compound`;
- `stepId`s are unique across the WHOLE program, not per track;
- every `task` a step occupies needs a matching `resourceConstraints` entry, and that entry's `maxConcurrent` is what stops two steps sharing one oven, one thermocycler or one PA;
- work repeated n times (n trays, n samples, n aircraft) is `replicates: {count: n, mode: "serial" | "parallel" | "stagger"}` on ONE step — never n hand-copied steps or tracks. Chain what follows each repetition with `{"type":"afterStep","stepId":"<step>","instances":"each"}`, give the step that waits for all of them `{"instances":"all"}`, and when the holding area between them only fits k at a time (a rack that holds two trays, a rotor that holds six tubes, a taxiway that holds two aircraft) set `replicates.maxInFlight: k` so the upstream step is held back instead of stranding the downstream one.

`rhylthyme://guide/authoring` is the full cheat-sheet, and `rhylthyme://schema/program` the schema, if you want to check a rule.

Then list the resource constraints you expect this {kind} to need — one `task` per line with the `maxConcurrent` you intend to declare and how many people are working — and end with that list as JSON in a single ```json fenced block:

{source}

List every timed activity you would have to perform, in the order the text gives it, with:

- a short kebab-case `stepId` and a human `name`;
- `task`: the resource it occupies while it runs — the oven, a burner, the thermocycler, the PA, the bench, your own hands. Use the same name every time for the same resource;
- how long it takes: exact (`fixed`), a range (`variable`), or "until I decide" (`indefinite`);
- `sourceSpan`: the exact words in the text you took it from, as `{"quote": "...", "occurrence": n}`, where n says which occurrence of those words you mean (1 for the first). Quote the text verbatim — do not paraphrase it;
- `inferred`: `true` for a step the text never states but the work needs anyway (preheating, thawing, resting, cooling, labelling, sound-check), with `"sourceSpan": null`. Keep these few and obvious.

Split anything the text bundles into one sentence when the parts occupy different resources or different stretches of time ("brown the meat, then simmer for 40 minutes" is two activities). Do not decide yet which activities can overlap, which track they belong to, or what waits for what.

T4_RELATIONSHIPS = """Turn 4 of 4 — relationships, then the program.

Take the step list from turn 3 exactly as it stands.

**First, tracks.** Put each step in a track: one track per parallel line of work — per dish, per station, per instrument, per performer, per sample group. Steps in one track run one after another and must not overlap; anything that runs while something else runs belongs in its own track.

**Second, triggers.** Give every step a `startTrigger` from this vocabulary and no other:

- `{"type":"programStart"}` — at t = 0.
- `{"type":"programStartOffset","offsetSeconds":n}` — n seconds after the start; this is how a short track is delayed so it finishes with the others.
- `{"type":"afterStep","stepId":"x"}` — when x ends. Add `"offsetSeconds"` for a gap, `"event":"start"` to hang off x's start instead of its end, `"instances"` when x is replicated.
- `{"type":"afterStepWithBuffer","stepId":"x","bufferSeconds":n}` — n seconds after x ends.
- `{"type":"manual"}` — the person taps to start it: a gate that no clock can predict (guests seated, dough looks right, the surgeon is ready).
- `{"type":"compound","logic":"all"|"any","triggers":[...]}` — wait for all of, or the first of, several triggers.

**Third, refine the question before you answer it.** Within the scope of scheduling these activities for one person to follow, suggest a better version of the question "which activities depend on which, and which can run at the same time?" — one that would expose dependencies this text implies but does not state: things that must cool, rest, preheat, thaw, proof, be held warm, or be ready at the same moment as something else. Write your improved question out, answer it, and revise the triggers accordingly. A step the improved question reveals is added here, marked `"inferred": true`.

**Then emit the complete program JSON** in a single ```json fenced block: `schemaVersion`, `programId`, `name`, `environmentType`, `actors`, `tracks`, and a `resourceConstraints` entry for every `task` any step uses. Carry turn 3's provenance onto each step as `"metadata": {"sourceSpan": ..., "inferred": ...}`.

```

Then finish the job with the tools:
1. If the public catalog already covers this ({catalogTools}), load that instead and stop — its result already has the live URL.
2. Otherwise keep the program you just built; `rhylthyme://guide/authoring` is the cheat-sheet and `rhylthyme://examples/*` are complete programs to pattern-match.
3. Express the limits as constraints, not as copied JSON: the `resourceConstraints`, `replicates`, `instances` and `maxInFlight` you confirmed in turn 2.
4. Run validate_program and fix every error it reports.
5. Run analyze_schedule{finishAtArg} to check the makespan, critical path and resource conflicts; adjust offsets so tracks finish together. Its `bindingConstraints` say which limit is actually gating the makespan.
6. Call visualize_schedule and give the user the live URL plus the Gantt/itinerary from the result. Do not describe the schedule in prose."""
