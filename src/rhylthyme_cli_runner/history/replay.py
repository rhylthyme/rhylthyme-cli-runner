"""
Replay: re-resolve a program's triggers against the ends that actually
happened, so a recorded run can be checked against the planner.

``freeze_planned`` answers "when did the plan say this step would run?".
``replay_timings`` answers the complementary question: "given the durations
that actually occurred, when *should* every trigger have fired?". Feeding a
record's observed ends back into the resolver and comparing the result with
``triggerFiredAt`` is the replay-parity check of PRD §8 item 1: it says the
timing engine and the live runtime agree about what a trigger means.

The resolver here is a port of the JavaScript ``computeStepTimings``
(``rhylthyme-timeline/src/index.js``), which agrees with the Python
reference ``calculate_step_start_time`` on the whole parity corpus. It is a
separate, small function rather than a patch to the validator because the
validator resolves a step at a time from the program alone, while a replay
needs one memoised pass with the observed ends substituted:

    programStart / programStartOffset -> max(0, offsetSeconds)
    afterStep                         -> ref.end (ref.start with event
                                         "start") + offsetSeconds
    afterStepWithBuffer               -> the same plus bufferSeconds
    a negative offset                 -> max(ref.start, ref.end + offset)
    manual / previousStepComplete     -> end of the previous step in the track
    { logic: "all" | "any", ... }      -> max / min of the sub-triggers

``ref.end`` is the step's OBSERVED end when the record has one, otherwise
its planned duration added to its resolved start, so an unfinished step does
not stall the pass.

Two trigger forms cannot be reproduced from the plan graph plus the observed
ends, and ``executor_gated`` names them (the replay tests skip exactly these):

* ``manual`` — the executor decides when, and nothing in the record predicts
  it;
* a negative ``offsetSeconds`` — a *hindsight* replay resolves it against the
  end that happened (``ref.end + offset``), but the live runtime had to fire
  it before the anchor ended, from the anchor's **projected** end
  (``ref.start + defaultSeconds + offset``, or the predicted duration when
  ``metadata.offsetsUse`` is ``"predicted"``). The two instants coincide only
  when the anchor took exactly as long as expected, so the replay cannot
  check this trigger — that is what ``rhylthyme runs evaluate`` measures
  instead.

``event: "start"`` used to be a third: the runner waited for the referenced
step to complete where the engine anchors on its start. Phase 7 fixed the
runner, and the form is now reproduced like any other dependency.
