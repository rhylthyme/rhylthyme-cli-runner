"""
Validator checks for schema 0.3.0-alpha `instances` triggers and
step-level `replicates` (PRD prd-per-instance-triggers-barriers §6.1).

This module is maintained by byte-copy in three places (see
tools/check_mirrors.sh); the root package is the source of truth:

    src/rhylthyme/instance_checks.py
    rhylthyme-cli-runner/src/rhylthyme_cli_runner/instance_checks.py
    rhylthyme-server/src/rhylthyme_server/rhylthyme/instance_checks.py

It must stay dependency-free: it runs on the UNEXPANDED program (the checks
are about `instances` / `replicates` declarations, which expansion removes)
and is called by both Python validators before replicate expansion.

Codes emitted here (fix hints verbatim from the PRD):

    E_INSTANCES_ON_SINGLE   `instances` set but `stepId` is not replicated
                            or "each"-derived
    E_EACH_WITH_REPLICATES  step has both an `instances: "each"` trigger and
                            its own `replicates`
    E_EACH_COUNT_MISMATCH   compound "each" over steps with different counts
    E_INFLIGHT_GT_COUNT     `replicates.maxInFlight` greater than `count`
    E_INFLIGHT_NO_CHAIN     `maxInFlight` on a serial replicate with no
                            "each" descendants, where it can have no effect
    W_UNBARRIERED_CHAIN     an "each" chain has no "all" barrier and the
                            program has later steps that reference nothing
                            in it (warning)

`I_IMPLICIT_BARRIER` is JS-only (PRD §9 Q5).
